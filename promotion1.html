        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1 Week<br>
           <strong>Role:</strong> Graphic Design, Layout Design, Branding</p>
    
        <p>
            This project explored how to represent an organizations mission through apparel-style artwork. 
            I focused on creating a design that felt bold, clean, and visually cohesive across potential 
            merch items like shirts, posters, and digital assets.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
    
            I started by meeting with the WCT team to understand the organization's mission and values.
             This helped me align the design with their goals and ensure it resonated with their target audience.
             We wanted to create a design that celebrated diversity and inclusivity in technology, so I focused on bold typography and dynamic character designs to convey inclusivity and innovation.
             Through brainstorming sessions and feedback loops, I was able to refine the concept and create a design that truly represented their vision.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            This project strengthened my skills in creating event-based visual identities while staying 
            intentional with hierarchy and composition. I also learned how small typographic tweaks can 
            completely shift the personality of a merch design. Overall, it was a fun opportunity to blend 
            branding, creativity, and apparel-focused thinking into one cohesive piece.
    
            
        </p>

        <p>It was an honor to be trusted with this design and I'm grateful for my mentor Shana Shanders for giving me this oppurtunity!</p>
