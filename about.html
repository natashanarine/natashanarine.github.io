        <div class="about-text">
            <p>
                I’m Natasha Narine, a first-generation student studying Computer Information Systems with an App Development concentration at Georgia State University. My interdisciplinary track allows me to combine a strong creative foundation with technical execution to solve real problems and bring ideas to life.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                I’m passionate about taking ideas from concept to execution, whether it’s an app, campus event, or personal project. I find the most fulfillment in creating experiences that bring people together, and I thrive in environments where curiosity, adaptability, and thoughtful problem-solving drive meaningful results. Above all, I aim to make technology enjoyable and purposeful, blending precision with personality in every project I take on.

<h3>My Process</h3>
<p>When approaching an ambiguous problem, this is the general outline I follow:</p>
<br>
   
    
        <div class="process-steps">
    
            <div class="process-step">
                <br>
                <h4>Envision Outcome</h4>
                <p>I start by defining what success looks like. When the problem no longer exists, what does that reality look like?</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="process-step">
                <br>
                <h4>Map the Steps</h4>
                <p>I define the problem space, outline key tasks, and prioritize what comes first, treating each roadmap like a journey that turns early ambiguity into a clear, actionable path.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="process-step">
                <br>
                <h4>Make it Exist Now, Refine Later</h4>
                <p>I let ideas exist in a rough form before polishing them, even the absurd or uncertain ones. This allows ideas to grow instead of getting stuck in perfection.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="process-step">
                <br>
                <h4>Organize and Elevate</h4>
                <p>I transform unstructured ideas into focused, high-quality solutions that are visually cohesive and grounded in intent.</p>
            </div>
    
        </div>
    
        <br>
        <p>
            This approach is how nearly every project in my portfolio, including this website, came to life. It’s an ideology I plan to carry into every future project and role, helping me stay adaptable, intentional, and turn ambiguity into clear, impactful outcomes.
        </p>
