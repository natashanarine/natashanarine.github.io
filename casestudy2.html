    <h2>TechRise — Student Productivity App Redesign</h2>
    <p>TechRise is a student-focused app designed to help learners organize tasks, track projects, and manage their academic workflow efficiently. This case study covers my redesign process, including research, wireframes, improved navigation, and final interface designs that increase usability and engagement.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 4 Weeks<br>
       <strong>Role:</strong> UX Designer — Research, Wireframing, UI Design, Prototyping</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>The original TechRise app had a cluttered interface, confusing navigation, and users often struggled to quickly find key tools for task and project management. My goal was to streamline workflows and simplify the interface to increase engagement and satisfaction.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>To understand user pain points, I conducted multiple forms of research by in-person interviews, a google form with survey questions, and researching existing platforms that performed similar tasks.</p>
    <br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User Interviews:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>“It’s hard to find advisors that have time to help me.”</li>
            <li>“By the time I find the posting, it's too late to apply.”</li>
            <li>“Switching between different platforms for internship postings gets frustrating.”</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Survey Responses:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>60% of students struggle to book appointments efficiently.</li>
            <li>90% want internship postings to be earier to access</li>
            <li>50% find the current interface confusing.</li>
            <li>30% want notifications/reminders for upcoming meetings.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Competitive Analysis Insights:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Existing advisor booking platforms are functional but not user-friendly.</li>
            <li>Internship boards (e.g., Handshake) have lots of postings but limited filtering and personalization.</li>
            <li>Students value simplicity and speed over extra features.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

    <h3>User Flows</h3>
    <p>Developed clear user flows for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding and categorizing tasks/projects</li>
        <li>Tracking progress and deadlines</li>
        <li>Accessing key resources and app features efficiently</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>Low and mid-fidelity wireframes were created to test layout, hierarchy, and navigation simplifications before moving into the final UI design.</p>

    <h3>Final UI</h3>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>This redesign improved the usability and accessibility of TechRise, helping students manage their academic workload more efficiently. I learned how to balance simplicity with functionality while maintaining a modern, engaging interface.</p>
