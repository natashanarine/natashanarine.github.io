    <h2>Rosa’s Pizza — Marketing Strategy and Website Redesign </h2>
    <p>This case study highlights how I helped modernize the Rosa's Pizza marketing direction while redesigning the website to improve visual appeal, strengthen brand consistency, and streamline the user flow.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> In Progress<br>
       <strong>Role:</strong> Design & Marketing Strategist — UX/UI, Research, Visual Design, Prototyping, Marketing Strategy</p>
       <p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Digital Marketing Plan and Modernized Website</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Rosa’s Pizza was in need of a refreshed, company-wide marketing strategy. their branding lacked consistency, their value proposition wasn’t clearly communicated, and their digital presence wasn’t effectively supporting customer engagement or sales. 
        As part of this broader redesign, I worked closely with Rosa’s Pizza to overhaul their website, which previously contained outdated information, an unappealing design, and confusing navigation that made it difficult for customers to find menus, locations, and ordering options.</p>

        <h2>This case study is still in progress, and final designs are on the way! Please reach out if you’d like a preview or have any questions.</h2>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>The redesign improved the website’s usability, updated all outdated information, and created a visually appealing interface that guides users efficiently to the information they need. This project taught me the importance of balancing brand personality with usability for small business websites.</p>
